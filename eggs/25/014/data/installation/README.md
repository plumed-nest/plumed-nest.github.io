## Hardware requirements

To run bAIes-IDP, you need:

* A linux workstation;
* Ideally, a multicore CPU (8 cores is sufficient).

## Software requirements

Make sure you have access to at least one of the following:
* Local Alphafold-2 installation. You can get Alphafold-2 [here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold);
* [Colabfold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) with distance distributions output. An implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/zshengyu14/ColabFold_distmats/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb)

Make sure you have installed in your system:
* [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com) to install the environment needed by the conversion scripts
* [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org)
* [LAMMPS (2 Aug. 2023)](https://download.lammps.org/tars/index.html) with [PLUMED](https://www.plumed.org): see installation instructions below.

## Setting up the Conda environment for the LAMMPS input preparation

The conversion to LAMMPS requires the use of the python library [intermol](https://github.com/shirtsgroup/InterMol).
You can make this environment by running on the terminal:

`conda env create -f baies.yml`

Where `baies.yml` is provided in this directory. The content is:

```name: baies

  - omnia

### GROMACS

GROMACS can be downloaded and installed from [here](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/download.html)

## Setting up LAMMPS with PLUMED

LAMMPS version 2 Aug. 2023 source code can be downloaded [here](https://download.lammps.org/tars/index.html)

For bAIes, LAMMPS must be patched with the file `patch_cmap.txt` provided in this directory. After downloading the source code of LAMMPS, go in the source code main directory and run:

`patch ./src/MOLECULE/fix_cmap.cpp < patch_cmap.txt`

Then, LAMMPS can be compiled using CMake (described [here](https://docs.lammps.org/Build_cmake.html)) or using make (described [here](https://docs.lammps.org/Build_make.html)).
In our system, LAMMPS was installed as follows using cmake. In the main directory:

`mkdir build`,
`cd build`,
`cmake -C ../cmake/presets/basic.cmake -D PKG_PLUMED=yes -D PLUMED_MODE=runtime ../cmake`

The argument `-D PLUMED_MODE=runtime` allows to call the wanted PLUMED installation at run time during the LAMMPS execution. The file in `cmake/presets/basic.cmake` allows us to set the additional packages to install with the LAMMPS source code. It may contain the following:

```
set(ALL_PACKAGES KSPACE MANYBODY MOLECULE RIGID GPU EXTRA-DUMP EXTRA-FIX KOKKOS)

foreach(PKG ${ALL_PACKAGES})
  set(PKG_${PKG} ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
endforeach()
```

Then:

`make`,
`sudo make install`

More details on the implementation of PLUMED is described [here](https://docs.lammps.org/Build_extras.html#plumed).
Make sure that bAIes is available in your version of PLUMED. If not, the user can install the branch v2.10 of PLUMED, which contains bAIes: [https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/tree/v2.10](https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/tree/v2.10).

We recommend the use of OpenMP for parallelization.
